# Astro-Template

> This template is not complete yet!

I created this template because I wanted to just fork/clone a repo and start making a project or start using the default template which comes with astro **without much configuration**, but the latter is not possible because Astro's default template does not look like what I want (and I don't want to use themes, if I would be more focused on styling). So, this repo is like the first scenario, where you can just clone/fork the repo and start making amazing projects.

## Tools (used in this template)

This template uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager, [Biomejs](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting, [React](https://react.dev/) and [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/) for creating components*, [Shadcn-UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as the Component Library, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling (you can also use css or sass), [Astro](https://astro.build/) as the JS Framework and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for its powers.

*by the way, you can also make components with Astro.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lalit293/astro-template.git
```

1. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

1. Start the dev server

```bash
bun run dev
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ common
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shadcn-ui
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shadcn-ui
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ global.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

In the `src/components/shadcn-ui` folder there are components provided by [Shadcn-UI Library](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
In the `src/components/common` folder you can put any of your  components.

While `src/lib/` folder serves you some utilities (in the folder `src/lib/shadcn-ui/`provided by [Shadcn-UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)) and you can make your own ones in the folder `src/lib/core`.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
